Plans for final project:

Proverb search engine with following features:

- data consisting of english proverbs/idioms and their explanations (this data we have already)

- maybe also data in other languages, e.g. finnish, spanish, french, german... (find data)
  - so if a user types in a query in spanish, the engine should recognize the language and make the search in the spanish data
  - unless the user wants to find results in an other language

- you can search for proverbs that contain a certain word or words
  e.g. "milk" -->  " Don't cry over spilt milk "
- you can also search for proverbs based on the meaning
  e.g. "mistake" --> " Don't cry over spilt milk "
  
- documents are parsed using tf-idf-vectorizer
  - documents are short so no need for bi-word or phrase queries (in any case the words will be close to each other) 
  - stemming is always on (or is there any need for exact word queries?)
  
- images or graphs
  - dependency trees... 
  - something else?

- after a search is made, propose other search words related to the original one (especially if nothing was found?)
  - maybe using spacy's similarity vectors but this might be a bit complicated
  - https://spacy.io/usage/vectors-similarity

- ✧ visually dashing (and elegant) user interface ✧
