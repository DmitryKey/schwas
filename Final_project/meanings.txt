22 There are various interpretations of the meaning of 'a friend in need is a friend indeed'. There is some debate about the meaning of this expression. Firstly, is it 'a friend in need is a friend indeed' or 'a friend in need is a friend in deed'? Secondly,  is it 'a friend (when you are) in need' or 'a friend (who is) in need'? If the former, then the phrase means: 'someone who helps you when you are in need is a true friend'. If the latter, it is 'someone who needs your help becomes especially friendly in order to obtain it'. So, that gives us four options: 1. A friend, (when you are) in need, is indeed a true friend. ('indeed') 2. A friend, (when you are) in need, is someone who is prepared to act to show it ('in deed') 3. A friend, (who is) in need, is indeed a true friend. ('indeed') 4. A friend, (who is) in need, is someone who is prepared to act to show it ('in deed') eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'phrases_org_uk-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',105,'0','0'])); The original meaning can be resolved to some degree by the documentary evidence - see below. Nevertheless, although most people have no doubt that No.1 is correct. There is no unambiguous right or wrong here and this is a phrase the meaning of which we probably infer  from the context in which we first hear it. Whichever of the above options we initially opt for will cement our understanding of the phrase, probably forever.

26 To be faced with a situation which is pointless, as a successful outcome is impossible. This is usually expressed in terms of a sporting contest in which one of two outcomes is foreseen, either a hiding or nothing. The 'to' in the phrase indicates alternative outcomes, as in terms like '6 to 1' or 'dollars to doughnuts'. The phrase has two applications. One scenario would be that of a team which is expected to win easily but has the betting odds so strongly in its favour that no kudos or reward, that is, 'nothing' , would be gained from victory. The other is that of a weak contestant who is expected to be beaten, that is, get 'a hiding'.
27 'A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse' is one of Shakespeare's best known lines. The king spoke the line in Act V of the play Richard III, after losing his horse in battle. More generally the meaning of the expression is that the speaker is in great need of a particular item and is willing to trade something of great value to get it. The quotation is sometimes now repeated ironically when someone is in need of some relatively unimportant item -  offering their 'kingdom' for, a cup of tea, or a warm coat, or whatever.
